      My research investigates how variation in environmental and maternal conditions shapes offspring development, behaviour and life history. I use a variety of approaches, including mathematical models, comparative analyses and empirical tests on unusual and important model systems, including the disease-carrying tsetse fly. I have studied variation in cooperation (PhD 2010, Cambridge) and growth (Postdoc 2009-12, Cambridge) in meerkats, and developmental determinants of ageing (2012-15, Oxford). I was awarded a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship in 2015, and moved to Bristol as (proleptic) Senior Lecturer in 2017. In October 2023, I started a UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship to investigate the interplay between infections and nutrition during pregnancy.

      <p>
        My interest lies with Applied Entomology and Ecology. I have an entomology background, having completed a Masters on the effect of pesticides on dung beetles (2018, Bristol) and an undergraduate dissertation project investigating the quantity of lipid maintained in blow flies. My research interests led me to begin a PhD on maternal investment in tsetse fly, vector of African trypanosome parasites. I am investigating the allocation of nutrients from mother to offspring under different environmental scenarios.

        My current research focuses on modelling the interactions between disease vectors and their microbiota. I have a multi-disciplinary background, having completed a Chemistry BSc (University of Bristol, 2018) before undertaking an MRes in Entomology (University of Reading, 2020), which has lead me to my current research. For my Master's I investigated the winter swarming behaviours of chironomid midges, as well as the changes in environmental associations of a habitat specialist bombylid, <i>Villa cingulata</i>.

      <p class='title'>University of Bristol Climate and Health Scholarship PhD Student</p>
      <p>
        My research interest lies with the effect of maternal environment on progeny health and survival. I graduated from the University of Bath having completed my Molecular Biosciences MSc (2021-2022) and my Biochemistry BSc(2018-2021). During my MSc I undertook projects studying the effects of maternal famine on progeny metabolism and analysing wound healing within the context of diabetes using zebrafish as a model. For my Bachelors final year project, I analysed the incorporation of endogenous traits such as axolotl limb regeneration into the human genome. My current PhD project focuses on the impact of heat on pregnancy outcomes through an interdisciplinary and cross-species approach.
