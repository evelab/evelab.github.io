      My research investigates how variation in environmental and maternal conditions shapes offspring development, behaviour and life history. I use a variety of approaches, including mathematical models, comparative analyses and empirical tests on unusual and important model systems, including the disease-carrying tsetse fly. I have studied variation in cooperation (PhD 2010, Cambridge) and growth (Postdoc 2009-12, Cambridge) in meerkats, and developmental determinants of ageing (2012-15, Oxford). I was awarded a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship in 2015, and moved to Bristol as (proleptic) Senior Lecturer in 2017.

      <p class='title'>BBSRC SWBio PhD Student</p>
      <p>
        My interest lies with Applied Entomology and Ecology. I have an entomology background, having completed a Masters on the effect of pesticides on dung beetles (2018, Bristol) and an undergraduate dissertation project investigating the quantity of lipid maintained in blow flies. My research interests led me to begin a PhD on maternal investment in tsetse fly, vector of African trypanosome parasites. I am investigating the allocation of nutrients from mother to offspring under different environmental scenarios.

      <p class='title'>MRes Student</p>
      <p>
        My research examines how social factors and movement patterns intreact in the Pacific beetle cockroach. I am currently working on my MRes part-time as I have recently joined London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as a Scientific Officer, where I am involved in the implementation and preparation of experiments investigating the mechanisms of human attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes. In 2018, I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Zoology. For my final year research project, I examined the genetic and ecological determinants of plasmid distribution in <i>E. coli</i>, which led to co-authorship on a publication (Dimitriu et al. 2019, Proceedings B).

      <p class='title'>Bristol (EPSRC) and Macquarie (Cotutelle) PhD Student</p>
      <p>
        My current research focuses on modelling the interactions between disease vectors and their microbiota. I have a multi-disciplinary background, having completed a Chemistry BSc (University of Bristol, 2018) before undertaking an MRes in Entomology (University of Reading, 2020), which has lead me to my current research. For my Master's I investigated the winter swarming behaviours of chironomid midges, as well as the changes in environmental associations of a habitat specialist bombylid, <i>Villa cingulata</i>.

        <p>
          My research interests include early life effects on development and life history traits. I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Zoology (2018) having completed an undergraduate dissertation on the embryonic development and survival of hoverflies in different humidity conditions; and was awarded an MRes from the University of Bristol (2021) on maternal and early social effects on development and life history in the Pacific beetle cockroach (<i>Diploptera punctata</i>). I am now working as a research technician in the lab investigating the effects of heat stress on pregnancy outcomes in <i>D. punctata</i>.
