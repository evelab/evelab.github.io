      My research investigates how variation in environmental and maternal conditions shapes offspring development, behaviour and life history. I use a variety of approaches, including mathematical models, comparative analyses and empirical tests on unusual and important model systems, including the disease-carrying tsetse fly. I have studied variation in cooperation (PhD 2010, Cambridge) and growth (Postdoc 2009-12, Cambridge) in meerkats, and developmental determinants of ageing (2012-15, Oxford). I was awarded a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship in 2015, and moved to Bristol as (proleptic) Senior Lecturer in 2017.

        I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in carry over effects, host parasites interactions, and vector biology. I am currently developing evolutionary models of maternal investment in tsetse flies and investigating the impacts on vector competence and the epidemiology of the animal/human African trypanosomiasis. I did my PhD on the ecology and evolution of malaria mosquito immunity (2016, University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland), and then combined evolutionary & applied ecology to improve malaria control during my first postdoc (2016-19, Penn State University, USA).

      <p class='title'>BBSRC SWBio PhD Student</p>
      <p>
        My interest lies with Applied Entomology and Ecology. I have an entomology background, having completed a Masters on the effect of pesticides on dung beetles (2018, Bristol) and an undergraduate dissertation project investigating the quantity of lipid maintained in blow flies. My research interests led me to begin a PhD on maternal investment in tsetse fly, vector of African trypanosome parasites. I am investigating the allocation of nutrients from mother to offspring under different environmental scenarios.

      <p class='title'>MRes Student</p>
      <p>
        My research examines how social factors and movement patterns intreact in the Pacific beetle cockroach. I am currently working on my MRes part-time as I have recently joined London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as a Scientific Officer, where I am involved in the implementation and preparation of experiments investigating the mechanisms of human attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes. In 2018, I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Zoology. For my final year research project, I examined the genetic and ecological determinants of plasmid distribution in <i>E. coli</i>, which led to co-authorship on a publication (Dimitriu et al. 2019, Proceedings B).

      <p>
        My current research focuses on modelling the interactions between disease vectors and their microbiota. I have a multi-disciplinary background, having completed a Chemistry BSc (University of Bristol, 2018) before undertaking an MRes in Entomology (University of Reading, 2020), which has lead me to my current research. For my Master's I investigated the winter swarming behaviours of chironomid midges, as well as the changes in environmental associations of a habitat specialist bombylid, <i>Villa cingulata</i>.

      <p class='title'>Visiting Master's Student (Feb - Jun 2021)</p>
      <p>
        I graduated from the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, with a BSc in Biology (2020). I am currently doing a Master's in Biology of Organisms and Ecology. For my master's thesis I focused on the effects of larval developmental conditions on adult personality for the butterfly <i>Pararge aegeria</i>. My interests in development and insects led me to complete my master's by an internship at the University of Bristol where I'm working on the effect of egg size on pupae size in tsetse flies.

      <p class='title'>BCAI Research Technician (Sep 2020 - Feb 2021)</p>
      <p>
        I am an entomologist with a special interest in agricultural pests, pollinators, biological control agents and insect rearing systems. I have previously studied the control of several agricultural pests using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) including biopesticides and parasitoids. I am interested in plant and insect interactions and my PhD was on the 'biological control of insect pests of legumes' under field conditions in Africa and laboratory conditions in Europe (University of Reading, 2020). During my research visit in EVE lab (funded by a BCAI grant), I conducted an experiment on the enhancement of neem (<i>Azadirachta indica</i>) for effective control of insect pests.

      <p class='title'>MRes Student (Sep 2019 - Jan 2021)</p>
      <p>
        My research interests include early life effects on development and life history traits. I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Zoology (2018) having completed an undergraduate dissertation on the embryonic development and survival of hoverflies in different humidity conditions. I have now completed a Master of Science by Research Degree with the EVE lab (2021). My research focused on the impact of  maternal and social effects during early life on the development and life history traits of the Pacific beetle cockroach.
