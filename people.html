      My research investigates how variation in environmental and maternal conditions shapes offspring development, behaviour and life history. I use a variety of approaches, including mathematical models, comparative analyses and empirical tests on unusual and important model systems, including the disease-carrying tsetse fly. I have studied variation in cooperation (PhD 2010, Cambridge) and growth (Postdoc 2009-12, Cambridge) in meerkats, and developmental determinants of ageing (2012-15, Oxford). I was awarded a Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Fellowship in 2015, and moved to Bristol as (proleptic) Senior Lecturer in 2017.

        I am an evolutionary ecologist interested in carry over effects, host parasites interactions, and vector biology. I am currently developing evolutionary models of maternal investment in tsetse flies and investigating the impacts on vector competence and the epidemiology of the animal/human African trypanosomiasis. I did my PhD on the ecology and evolution of malaria mosquito immunity (2016, University of Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland), and then combined evolutionary & applied ecology to improve malaria control during my first postdoc (2016-19, Penn State University, USA).

        My interest lies with Applied Entomology and Ecology. I have an entomology background, having completed a Masters on the effect of pesticides on dung beetles (2018, Bristol) and an undergraduate dissertation project investigating the quantity of lipid maintained in blow flies. My research interests led me to begin a PhD on maternal investment in tsetse fly, vector of African trypanosome parasites. I am investigating the allocation of nutrients from mother to offspring under different environmental scenarios.

        I have a BSc in Zoology (2018, Exeter). For my final year research project, I examined the genetic and ecological determinants of plasmid distribution in <i>E. coli</i>, which led to co-authorship on a publication (Dimitriu et al. 2019, Proceedings of the Royal Society B). Currently, I am interested in the effects early life experiences have on development. My research will investigate how the social environment in early life shapes behaviour and cognition in the Pacific beetle cockroach.

        My research interests include early life effects on development and life history traits. I graduated from the University of Exeter with a BSc in Zoology (2018) having completed an undergraduate dissertation on the embryonic development and survival of hoverflies in different humidity conditions. I am currently undertaking a Masters by Research focusing on the Pacific beetle cockroach. My project will investigate the effect of social interactions during early life on development and later life history, including body size and reproduction.
